                      <p class="paragraph">Our community service model is unique in Toronto. Most at-risk young people who are in care will see many different
                        service providers before they’re 19 years old. At BBYOS we understand that at-risk youth and families need a therapeutic relationship without time constraints and limitations, one that is based on an ongoing commitment to help them through the trials and tribulations of making serious, sustainable changes in their lives. We work intensively with young people and families over several years, for as long as it takes. Once you are a client we will
                        serve you until you decide you are done. We have clients that started with us as teens and have continued or come back to us years later as adults / parents. Our multi-generational approach also means we are working to prevent crime, reduce anti-social behavior and develop healthy relationships, rather than reacting after the negative patterns have been deeply established. We started in 1989 with one therapist, whose office was a park bench on Blake Street. Today the BBYOS office at 41 Blake Street is an integral part of the Blake-Boultbee community. Being immersed in the neighbourhood means we are accessible 5 days a week and we are present in the event of a crisis or conflict in the community.
                         And our constant presence has helped us build trusting relationships with the community.</p>

                <p class="paragraph" style="color: white">Our trusted relationship with the community is absolutely vital to our work as counselors and therapists. This trust is important in encouraging the development of self-esteem; treating mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, and living with psychotic illnesses such as bi-polar disorder; supporting survivors of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; developing parenting skills; helping with job / apartment seeking; counselling about drug and alcohol abuse; and educating about sexuality and sexual health. The positive results of our long-term therapeutic approach are evident in the number of clients who have turned away from anti-social/criminal behavior; including involvement in gangs, drugs and gun culture. The ultimate success is when clients have
established themselves with stable employment and positive family and interpersonal relationships.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">We have seen remarkable growth and change from our youngest clients through their participation in the girls or boys groups. Each group brings together 6 to 8 youth and stays with them through their teen years. Our groups provide an opportunity to learn, to laugh, to cry, to discover argument and disagreement without violence, to trust and be trusted, to hold each other in confidence, to be challenged and held to account, to learn valuable life skills like cooking and cleaning up afterwards. Each week they plan, prepare and eat a healthy meal. Sometimes they go on outings, to films and shows or to see cultural events. And there are always emergency personal needs that arise, that their BBYOS counselor can help them with, often in private sessions. The young people come to the group voluntarily and take great pride in their membership; and we are equally proud of them.</p>

                <p class="paragraph" style="color: white;"> We also reach out to our target population by meeting them in places other than our office. BBYOS provides advocacy and support for clients in school, at home, in the work place, in court and during incarceration. We help find independent housing for young people who must leave violent and emotionally unstable homes. We provide clients with emergency provisions and means of transportation (e.g. TTC fare) to enable them to get to school, to work, to job interviews and to important appointments.</p>
